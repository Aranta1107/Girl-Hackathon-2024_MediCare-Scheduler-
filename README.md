# MediCare Scheduler 

HealthAlign is an healthcare appointment scheduling system that uses AI techniques to match users with the most suitable doctors based on their symptoms, preferences, and doctor availability.

# Features

-Symptom-Based Matching: Users can input their symptoms, and the system uses machine learning to predict possible diseases and recommend relevant doctors.
  
- Doctor Recommendation: Based on the predicted disease and user preferences (such as preferred days and shift), the system recommends the most suitable doctor from a database of healthcare providers.

- Appointment Scheduling: Once a doctor is recommended, the system schedules an appointment for the user, taking into account the doctor's availability and the user's preferred schedule.

- Automatic Appointment Number Assignment: The system assigns the next available appointment number to the user and updates the doctor's appointment schedule accordingly.
